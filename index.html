        <h1 class="subs">My Projects</h1>
        <p>Here you will find a comprehensive list of my projects that involve computer science. The list includes the names of each project, a link to the project, and a brief description of what the project was and how it developed my skills further within the subject. Most of these project's code can be found onn GitHub and therefore a link to my GitHub account can be found <a href="https://github.com/20thollings">here</a>.</p>
        <h2 class="projects">Portfolio wesbite</h2>
        <p>The first project I completed was the very website you are on right now. Going into this project I only knew python thus this project was very valuable to my progress in computer science. By forcing me to learn new programming languages, those being html and css. This not only gave me a low level of proficiency in two more languages but also helped improve my ability to code by getting me familiar with learning and using languages that were very different from the syntax I was used to.</p>
